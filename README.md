# Appointly | Manage your appointments with ease 

## 1. Requirements & User Stories (Discovery Phase)
Break down requirements from 3 perspectives:

### ðŸ‘¤ Users
As a client, I can:
- Browse available services/providers.
- View provider availability (calendar slots).
- Book/cancel/reschedule appointments.
- Get reminders (email/notification).
- View my upcoming & past appointments.

As a provider, I can:
- Approve/reject/cancel bookings.
- Manage services (title, price, duration).
- See dashboard (list of todayâ€™s appointments, analytics).

As an admin (optional, Phase 2), I can:

- Manage all providers & users.
- Monitor bookings & system health.

Service flow :
user requesed the appointment (PENDING)
provider scheduled the appointment (CONFIRMED)
user cancelled the appointment (CANCELLED)
user attend appointment (COMPLETED)

## 2. Tech stack :

- **Frontend**: [`Next.js`, `TailwindCSS`].
- **State Management**: [`Zustand` ].
- **Database**: [`Supabase` , `Drizzle ORM`]
- **Calendar UI**: [ `React Calendar` , `FullCalendar`].
- **Reminders: Email**: (Resend, Nodemailer) / optional push notifications.
