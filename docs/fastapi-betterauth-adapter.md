Please refactor the `guide.md` file content by following this helpful guide .

## Content Quality & Focus :
**Accuracy and Authority**:
 Content must be technically correct and well-researched. You must present information as fact, provide supporting references or proof.

**Clarity and Simplicity**: Complex topics should be made simpler, not more complicated. Avoid excessive jargon or define acronyms for a broad audience. The writing style should be concise, using short words, sentences, and paragraphs for easy reading.

**Practicality and Actionability**: Content that readers can use immediately, such as step-by-step guides, code snippets, or real-world examples (e.g., how a specific function works or how to fix a common error).

**Problem-Solving Orientation**: The primary goal is to help the reader solve a problem or learn a new skill. The introduction should clearly state what problem the post will address and why it is worth reading.

## Presentation & User Experience :
**Strong Formatting**: Leverage formatting heavily with clear headings, subheadings, bullet points, and code blocks to make the content scannable. Many readers skim for relevant parts, so good structure is essential.

**Readability**: Content should be easy to read .
